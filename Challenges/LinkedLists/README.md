# Implement A Singly Linked List

A linked list is a series of dodes that are linked to one another. What makes a linked list so
is that each ndoe references the next node in the link.

There are two types - Singly and Doubly and below is the implementation of a Singly Linked List.

Uses of Linked Lists:
* Dynamic Allocation of Memory rather than a set declaration like an array
* Foundation of several other data structure implementations

## Challenge
After learning about the concept of linked lists, Implement your own Singly Linked List that has
the following functionality.
* Add a node to the front the the list
* Find an existing node
* Add a node to the end of the list
* Add a new node before an existing node
* Add a new node after an existing node
* Prints list

There consist a LinkList Class (to avoid fighting VS intellisense) and a Node Class.

Unit tests are provided with this challenge
