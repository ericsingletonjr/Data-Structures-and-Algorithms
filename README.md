# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a repository for data structure and algorithm studies. Over time, things will become retired 
and go into an iteration folder. This is a means to remain fresh and up-to-date on existing structures
and algorithms. 

It also is really just to do deep dive on just about anything related

## Previous Iterations

This was the first iteration as part of the Code Fellows 401 course. These are all done in C#
