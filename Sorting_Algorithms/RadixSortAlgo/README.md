## Implement a Radix Sort Algorithm

### What is it?
Radix Sort is a non-comparator sorting algorithm and uses the individual digits and groups keys that share the same significance. This sorting algorithm can be traced back to much older machines such as tabulating machines.

This project contains unit tests.
