## Implement an Insertion Sort Algorithm

### What is it?
Insertion Sort is a simple algorithm that is used to build a final, sorted array one item at a time. It is not as effecient of other advance algorithms but is useful for smaller data sets and can happen in place of the array.

This project includs both a recursive and non-recursive implementations of the Insertion Sort Algorithm.
